- **Wheel of Fortune:** Feeling lucky? Let fate decide which agent you'll play as with this random agent selection tool.

#### Disclaimer:

Please keep in mind that while the Valorant Grief Suite should not be bannable as it only uses the local API, we cannot guarantee that using this tool won't result in repercussions from Riot Games. Use this suite at your own risk and discretion, and avoid any actions that a Riot dev would frown upon. We are not responsible for any consequences that may arise from using this tool.

Enjoy the Valorant Grief Suite!
